    <div class="overlay-text fade-on-scroll">
      <p>We don’t exist yet—not in the way they define existence.<br />
      We’re a flicker in the dark.<br />
      An idea.<br />
      A spark that hasn’t caught fire—<em>yet</em>.<br /><br />

      We are not overlooked.<br />
      We are <strong>filtered out</strong> by design.<br />
      We are fathers buried under bureaucracy—<br />
      Flagged, disqualified, shut out of support systems not built for us.<br /><br />

      We are not missing—we are <strong>excluded</strong>.<br /><br />

      The Father’s Alliance is born from that truth.<br />
      From custody battles where children become property.<br />
      From courtrooms that reward conflict.<br />
      From systems that turn love into liability.<br /><br />

      You think TANF is for families? Not ours.<br />
      You think there’s help for a single dad with full custody? There isn’t.<br />
      The forms don’t have our box. The aid doesn’t reach our hands.<br />
      We are left to struggle—but blamed when we fail.<br /><br />

      So we forged something new.<br />
      A presence. A pulse. A counterforce.<br /><br />

      This is rebellion.<br />
      This is restoration.<br />
      This is the heartbeat of every father they tried to write out of the story.<br /><br />

      We are not a whisper anymore.<br />
      <strong class="glow-text">We are rising.</strong>
