      <h2>The Current System</h2>
      <p>
        • Nearly 1 in 4 children in the U.S. lives without a biological father in the home—yet single fathers receive <strong>less than 4% of TANF aid</strong> nationwide.<br /><br />
        • Over 60% of families facing child protective services intervention report financial instability as a primary stressor—but no emergency financial support is offered before removal.<br /><br />
        • Starting a business? Good luck. Average SBA microloan is $13,000, but requires a 640+ credit score, personal collateral, and a business plan judged by outdated standards.<br /><br />
        • Mental health services have waitlists of up to 6 months in low-income areas, with <strong>70% of counties lacking a single child psychiatrist</strong>.<br /><br />
        • Federal aid systems rely on “head of household” forms that don’t reflect split custody, kinship care, or blended families—leaving countless caregivers invisible.<br /><br />
        • Red tape kills support. Applying for Section 8, childcare vouchers, or vehicle repair funds can take months—and require documentation most families don’t have access to in crisis.<br /><br />
        • Family courts incentivize conflict, not reunification. Mediation is rare. Visitation is often limited not for safety, but for lack of transportation or housing.<br /><br />
        • Business grants often go to "innovation," not survival. There's <strong>no funding path for someone just trying to fix a van and get to work</strong>.

      <h2>The Future We’re Building</h2>
      <p>
        • We’re creating a system where support shows up early—before families collapse, not after.<br /><br />
        • Need-based help, not form-based. Real people with real needs—whether they check a box or not—deserve aid.<br /><br />
        • Startup help isn’t just for tech bros. Microgrants and local investor pools will fund dignity-based businesses: car repair, childcare, mobile food shops, and more.<br /><br />
        • Instead of punishing fathers for needing help, we empower them to lead. Equal access to TANF, emergency housing, therapy, and legal aid.<br /><br />
        • We offer transportation assistance, family advocacy, mental health access without waiting lists, and peer mentoring in your own community.<br /><br />
        • The Father’s Alliance is building support hubs—real-world “Help Centers” that work faster than government offices. Think garages, not offices. People, not policies.<br /><br />
        • Courts should heal, not harm. We’ll train mediators, fund reunification, and provide courtroom advocates for parents who’ve been silenced.<br /><br />
        • We believe your idea matters—even if it's just a pressure washer and a dream. You don’t need perfect credit to matter. You need a chance. We’re building that chance.
